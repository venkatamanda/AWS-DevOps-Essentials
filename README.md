# AWS DevOps Essentials

## An Introductory Workshop on CI/CD Practices

In few hours, quickly learn how to effectively leverage various AWS services to improve developer productivity and reduce the overall time to market for new product capabilities. In this session, we will demonstrate a prescriptive approach to incrementally adopt and embrace some of the best practices around continuous integration & delivery using AWS Developer Tools and 3rd party solutions including, AWS CodeCommit (a managed source control service), AWS CodeBuild (a fully managed build service), Jenkins (an open source automated build server), CodePipeline (a fully managed continuous delivery service), and CodeDeploy (an automated application deployment service). We will also highlight some best practices and productivity tips that can help make your software release process fast, automated, and reliable.

See the diagram below for a depiction of the complete architecture.

## Prerequisites

* **Configure AWS CodeCommit:** The easiest way to set up AWS CodeCommit is to configure HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit. On the user details page in IAM console, choose the **Security Credentials** tab, and in **HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit**, choose **Generate**. ![HTTPS Git Credential](./img/codecommit-iam-gc1.png)
        **ðŸ’¡ Note:** Make Note of the Git HTTP credentials handy. It will be used for cloning and pushing changes to Repo.
          Also, You can find detail instruction on how to configure HTTPS Git Credential [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html)
* **IAM Permissions:** Finally, for the AWS account ensure you have sufficient privileges. You must have permissions for the following services:

AWS Identity and Access Management

Amazon Simple Storage Service

AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeBuild
